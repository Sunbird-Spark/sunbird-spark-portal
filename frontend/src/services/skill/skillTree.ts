 * Fixed nesting would silently drop the deeper branches.
 *
 * A leaf is a term with no children, which is the only thing tagged, required by a role or
 * held by a learner. Interior terms are navigation only, so they contribute labels and a
 * path but never appear as skills.
 *
 * `seen` guards against a cycle in the authored data: `children` is a graph relation, and a
 * term that (directly or transitively) contains itself would otherwise recurse until the
 * stack blows - taking the whole profile page with it.
